                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials known for their fuzzy fur and cuddly appearance. They are arboreal herbivores, meaning they live in trees and eat plants, primarily eucalyptus leaves. Koalas have a specialized digestive system to extract nutrients from the tough eucalyptus leaves. They are solitary animals, each with its own home range, and are also known for their distinct black nose and large, fluffy ears. 
</p>
                    <p>Koalas are primarily nocturnal, sleeping up to 18 hours a day to conserve energy. They are not bears, despite being commonly referred to as "koala bears." Koalas are native to Australia and are often associated with the country's unique wildlife. They have a slow reproductive</p>
                    <p>Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on them. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Like other marsupials, koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. They crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they live for their first six to seven months. They are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.</p>
                    <p>Because of their distinctive appearance, koalas, along with kangaroos, are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia. They were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description in 1814 although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, thereby introducing the species to the British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by English scientists. Koalas are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts, and associated bushfires, some related to climate change. In February 2022, the koala was officially listed as endangered in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Koalas are native to Australia and are primarily found in the eastern and southeastern regions of the country. They inhabit eucalyptus forests, woodlands, and coastal areas, where they rely on eucalyptus trees for food and shelter. Some specific locations where you might find koalas include national parks like Great Otway National Park in Victoria, Noosa National Park in Queensland, and Kangaroo Island in South Australia.</p>
